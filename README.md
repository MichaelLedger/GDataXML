## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like GDataXMLNode_iOS in your projects.

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build GDataXMLNode_iOS 2.0.0+.

#### Podfile

To integrate GDataXMLNode_iOS into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '6.0'

target 'TargetName' do
pod 'GDataXMLNode_iOS', '~> 2.0.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Terminal Commands
```
$ pod spec create GDataXMLNode
$ pod lib lint --allow-warnings
$ git config --list
$ git config remote.origin.url https://MichaelLedger@github.com/MichaelLedger/GDataXML.git

# new tag version equal to podspec spec.version 
$ git tag 1.0.0
$ git push origin 1.0.0
```
